# Desktop App Launcher

# Idea
To create an app that allows a user to declutter their desktop and keep an organized catalog of shortcuts to run their apps all in one place

# Basis
Steam is an app launcher mainly used to launch games bought off of their marketplace. It does offer users the ability to add shortcuts to apps and programs purchased or downloaded elsewhere, however, many nice features it offers to its own apps in the launcher will not apply to these apps. These features include; logging playtime, adding custom background images, etc.

# New app model
Steam is a great platform for launching games, and the rare tool found on the marketplace, however it is not an elegant tool for launching apps in general. The desktop app launcher could provide an alternative solution that could be more useful to the average computer user, such as people working in business environments who want quick access to their computing tools, or computer programmers seeking to have their programming tools all in one neat place. Whatever the use case, the desktop app launcher could provide an elegant solution to a cluttered desktop environment for anyone, and avoids branding and brand features associated with platforms such as steam.

# Why this app launcher will stand out
There exist tools to solve this problem, albeit rare, however many of them are designed for use specific cases; such as gaming. They make it really easy to add your steam/epic/origin libraries to their app, however not to add categories for business tools. Most of these platforms also do not make it easy to add custom features, such as background images, runtime logging, specific category headers for app organization, or shortcut launch parameters. Many of these apps are also needlessly ugly. None of these features should be particularly difficult to implement, creating a gap in the market for a new tool to be created.

# Method
Many modern lightweight apps with elegant UIs are being developed using React (Discord, Slack, VScode). Native desktop apps in particular are being developed using React Ionic and Electron. These javascript frameworks are incredibly powerful and should easily provide the tools necessary to create this app launcher, including leaving room to develop cross platform (MacOS, Linux, and Windows). I propose using React and Electron to develop this app.
